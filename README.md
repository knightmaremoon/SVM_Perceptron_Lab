# SVM and Perceptron Classification Lab

## Overview
This repository contains a lab exploring **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** and **Perceptron** algorithms for binary classification. The experiment focuses on comparing the performance of these classifiers using the scikit-learn **digits dataset**. Additionally, heatmap visualizations are used to represent data and model weights.

## Contents
- **SVM Classifier**: Experiment with binary classification using SVM.
- **Perceptron Classifier**: Implementing the Perceptron algorithm for classification.
- **Visualization**: Heatmaps to visualize the digit dataset and model decision boundaries.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - scikit-learn
  - numpy
  - matplotlib

To install the necessary libraries, you can run:
```bash
pip install scikit-learn numpy matplotlib
```
# Usage
Run the notebook to:

- Train and test both SVM and Perceptron models.
- Visualize the decision boundaries and heatmaps of the dataset and model weights.
